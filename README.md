# SymToeplitzEigen

This package implements solving eigenvalues and eigenvectors of symmetric Toeplitz-like matrices in low precision on the GPU (using [CUDA.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGPU/CUDA.jl)) and then using Iterative Refinement (inspired by [IterativeRefinement.jl](https://github.com/RalphAS/IterativeRefinement.jl)) in parallel to improve the accuracy.

## Exported functions:

```julia
vals, vecs = Eigen(A)
```

where `A` is a symmetric Toeplitz-like matrix.

```julia
vals, vecs = Eigen(n, vc)
```

where `n` is the size of the matrix, `vc` is the first column of symmetric Toeplitz matrix.

<!-- #Refinement_precision :: Integer = 256, Max_iter :: Integer = 10, tol_fact :: Integer = 1 -->

## Optional keyword arguemnts:

* `Low_pres_type :: Type = Float32`

    The data type to do the initial low precision computation. Should either be `Float32` or `Float64`. Not used if given matrix is already one of these types.
  

<br />

* `Refinement_precision :: Integer = 256`
    
    The precision up to which the eigenvalues and eigenvectors should be computed. Automatically computed if the given symmetric Toeplitz-like matrix is of type `BigFloat`.

<br />

* `Max_iter :: Integer = 100`

    The maximum number of iterations of Iterative Refinement to perform.

    <br />

* `tol_fact :: Integer = 1`

    The tolerance factor up to which the error is computed, that is the error estimate is computed up to `tol_fact*eps(BigFloat)` where `BigFloat` has precision `Refinement_precision`
